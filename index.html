    <h2>Education</h2>
   <p>

    <h3>Pre-primary - Middle School</h3>
    Unlike the young children now a days, I did not  start my education from Early Childhood Center(ECCD). Rather, I directly got enrolled in class PP in the year 2010 in Mongar Lower 
    Secondary School when I was 4 and half years old. Starting from that year, I continued my schoolings in that same school, which was then upgraded to middle school. I had completed 
    my education for past 10 years in that same school. Thus, this school holds a special place in my heart. All my childhood memories were created in this school.  


    <h4>High School</h4>
    To continue my high school, I got enrolled in Mongar Higher Secondary School in the year 2021. It is located just above my middle school. 
    In grade 11, I took Arts as my stream as I was interested in subjects like English, Geography, Economics, etc...  During my high school days,
    I was able to explore a bit more and interact with lots of new friends as all the students from different places gathered together in one school. 
    Reminiscing about the memories that I had created in grade 12 was an exciting and an interesting part of my high school days. Being the senior most
    student in the school, we could enjoy the freedom, and the opportunities that we get to control over our younger juniors.
    I feel forever grateful to all my teachers for their guidance, supports, and punishments. With their guidance, I was able to perform well in
    my BHSEC examinations. Remembering about high school days makes me want to go back.
